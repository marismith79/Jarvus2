# Memory Editing & Improvement System

## Overview

The Memory Editing & Improvement System is a comprehensive suite of capabilities that allows the Jarvus agent to not just store and retrieve memories, but to actively improve, merge, and evolve them over time. This system transforms static memory storage into a dynamic, self-improving knowledge base.

## Key Features

### âœ… **IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

#### 1. Memory Merging & Consolidation
- **Similarity Detection**: Automatically finds memories with high similarity scores
- **Intelligent Merging**: Combines similar memories into richer, more comprehensive ones
- **Type-Specific Merging**: Different merging strategies for episodic, procedural, and semantic memories
- **Metadata Preservation**: Tracks original memory IDs and merge history

**Example Use Case:**
```python
# Find memories about email checking
mergeable_groups = memory_service.find_mergeable_memories(
    user_id=user_id, 
    namespace='episodes', 
    similarity_threshold=0.85
)

# Merge similar email checking memories
merged_memory = memory_service.merge_memories(
    user_id=user_id,
    memory_ids=['mem_001', 'mem_002', 'mem_003'],
    merge_type='episodic'
)
```

#### 2. Memory Improvement & Enhancement
- **Procedural Enhancement**: Adds error handling, validation steps, and optimization to workflows
- **Semantic Enhancement**: Enriches facts with context, confidence levels, and related concepts
- **Episodic Enhancement**: Adds insights, causal analysis, and performance metrics
- **Automatic Improvement**: AI-powered enhancement based on memory type

**Example Use Case:**
```python
# Improve a workflow procedure
improved_memory = memory_service.improve_memory(
    user_id=user_id,
    memory_id='proc_001',
    improvement_type='procedural'
)

# The improved workflow now includes:
# - Validation steps after each action
# - Error handling and recovery
# - Performance metrics
# - Success verification
```

#### 3. Memory Quality Assessment
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Completeness, accuracy, usefulness, clarity, consistency
- **Automated Evaluation**: Real-time quality assessment of all memories
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific suggestions for enhancing memory quality
- **Quality Reports**: Comprehensive analysis of memory system health

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Completeness**: How much information is available
- **Accuracy**: Reliability of the information
- **Usefulness**: How actionable the memory is
- **Clarity**: How clear and understandable the memory is
- **Consistency**: How well it aligns with other memories

#### 4. Memory Conflict Detection & Resolution
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies conflicting memories based on content analysis
- **Conflict Classification**: Categorizes conflicts by type (outcome, temporal, data)
- **Intelligent Resolution**: Resolves conflicts using importance scores and recency
- **Resolution Tracking**: Maintains history of conflict resolutions

**Conflict Types:**
- **Outcome Conflicts**: Same action, different results
- **Temporal Conflicts**: Inconsistent timestamps
- **Data Conflicts**: Contradictory information

#### 5. Memory Evolution Tracking
- **Version History**: Tracks all changes to memories over time
- **Change Types**: Records updates, merges, improvements, and conflict resolutions
- **Evolution Timeline**: Shows how memories have evolved
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history for debugging and analysis

#### 6. Bulk Operations & Automation
- **Bulk Improvement**: Improve multiple memories simultaneously
- **Auto-Consolidation**: Automatically merge similar memories
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large memory sets
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor bulk operation progress

### Service Layer (`memory_service.py`)

The core functionality is implemented in the `MemoryService` class with these key methods:

```python
class MemoryService:
    def find_mergeable_memories(self, user_id, namespace, similarity_threshold=0.85)
    def merge_memories(self, user_id, memory_ids, merge_type='episodic')
    def improve_memory(self, user_id, memory_id, improvement_type='auto')
    def assess_memory_quality(self, user_id, memory_id)
    def detect_memory_conflicts(self, user_id, namespace)
    def resolve_memory_conflicts(self, user_id, conflicts)
    def get_memory_evolution(self, user_id, memory_id)
```

### Route Layer (`routes/memory.py`)

RESTful API endpoints that expose the memory editing capabilities:

```python
@memory_bp.route('/api/memory/find-mergeable', methods=['GET'])
@memory_bp.route('/api/memory/merge', methods=['POST'])
@memory_bp.route('/api/memory/improve/<memory_id>', methods=['POST'])
@memory_bp.route('/api/memory/assess-quality/<memory_id>', methods=['GET'])
@memory_bp.route('/api/memory/detect-conflicts', methods=['GET'])

```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Merging Similar Memories

```python
# Find memories that can be merged
response = requests.get('/api/memory/find-mergeable?namespace=episodes&similarity=0.8')
mergeable_groups = response.json()['mergeable_groups']

# Merge the first group
if mergeable_groups:
    group = mergeable_groups[0]
    memory_ids = [memory['memory_id'] for memory in group['memories']]
    
    merge_data = {
        "memory_ids": memory_ids,
        "merge_type": "episodic"
    }
    
    response = requests.post('/api/memory/merge', json=merge_data)
    merged_memory = response.json()['merged_memory']
```

### 2. Improving Procedural Memories

```python
# Improve a workflow procedure
improvement_data = {
    "improvement_type": "procedural"
}

response = requests.post('/api/memory/improve/proc_001', json=improvement_data)
improved_memory = response.json()['improved_memory']

# The improved memory now includes:
# - Validation steps
# - Error handling
# - Performance metrics
# - Success verification
```

### 3. Quality Assessment

```python
# Assess individual memory quality
response = requests.get('/api/memory/assess-quality/mem_001')
quality_data = response.json()

print(f"Overall Score: {quality_data['overall_score']}")
print(f"Completeness: {quality_data['quality_scores']['completeness']}")
print(f"Suggestions: {quality_data['suggested_improvements']}")

# Get comprehensive quality report
response = requests.get('/api/memory/quality-report?namespace=episodes')
report = response.json()

print(f"Total Memories: {report['quality_report']['total_memories']}")
print(f"Low Quality: {len(report['quality_report']['low_quality_memories'])}")
print(f"High Quality: {len(report['quality_report']['high_quality_memories'])}")
```

### 4. Conflict Resolution

```python
# Detect conflicts
response = requests.get('/api/memory/detect-conflicts?namespace=episodes')
conflicts = response.json()['conflicts']

# Resolve conflicts
if conflicts:
    resolve_data = {"conflicts": conflicts}
    response = requests.post('/api/memory/resolve-conflicts', json=resolve_data)
    resolutions = response.json()['resolutions']
```

### 5. Bulk Operations

```python
# Bulk improve multiple memories
bulk_data = {
    "memory_ids": ["mem_001", "mem_002", "mem_003"],
    "improvement_type": "auto"
}

response = requests.post('/api/memory/bulk-improve', json=bulk_data)
results = response.json()

print(f"Improved: {results['improved_count']}")
print(f"Failed: {results['failed_count']}")

# Auto-consolidate similar memories
response = requests.post('/api/memory/auto-consolidate?namespace=episodes&similarity=0.8')
consolidation_results = response.json()
```
